# Kivy-Chat
Chat application based on kivy. Supports both Python2(asyncore) and Python3(asyncio).

___

For testing, run the server first, then you can run main.py:

`python3 server.py`

`python3 main.py`

___

The default IP address is `0.0.0.0` or `127.0.0.1`(It's the same thing), you can change it later as you like.

But just have to make sure that the `server.py` and the `main.py` files got the same port and IP address, so they can communicate correctly.

And I also created a client_example for you guys to understand what happens when app is working.
